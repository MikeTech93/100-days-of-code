## Log

### R1D1 - 30th May 2021, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**
Completed day 1 of 100-days-of-code Python Pro Bootcamp on Udemy and practiced some basic coding features such as strings and variables.

**Thoughts:**
I understand that following tutorials is not 100% following the #100DaysOfCode rules but I have started a 100-days-of-code python course on Udemy which has a project per day to complete.

### R1D2 - 02nd June 2021, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**
Completed day 2 of 100-days-of-code Python Pro Bootcamp on Udemy and practiced some basic coding features such as working with numbers and string\type manipulation.

**Thoughts:**
Progressed well, unfortunately I was a day late on this as I started work yesterday but did not get time to upload because I worked late into the evening. I understad this isn't a valid excuse so I'm going to make sure in future that I get this updated on a daily basis.

**Today's Progress:**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### R1D3 - 1st June 2021, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
