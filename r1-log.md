The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [30th May 2021]

## Log

### R1D1 - 30th May 2021, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**
Completed day 1 of 100-days-of-code Python Pro Bootcamp on Udemy and practiced some basic coding features such as strings and variables.

**Thoughts:**
I understand that following tutorials is not 100% following the #100DaysOfCode rules but I have started a 100-days-of-code python course on Udemy which has a project per day to complete.

### R1D2 - 02nd June 2021, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**
Completed day 2 of 100-days-of-code Python Pro Bootcamp on Udemy and practiced some basic coding features such as working with numbers and string\type manipulation.

**Thoughts:**
Progressed well, unfortunately I was a day late on this as I started work yesterday but did not get time to upload because I worked late into the evening. I understad this isn't a valid excuse so I'm going to make sure in future that I get this updated on a daily basis.

### R1D3 - 3rd June June 2021, Thursday

**Today's Progress:**
Made good progress on day 3 of 100-days-of-code Python Pro Bootcamp but did not finish it completely.

**Thoughts:**
Perfomed 5 coding exercises which I found really enjoyable. The leap year exercise was certainly challenging but printing out some text on each if statement helped me solve the issue. I will need to put in quite a bit of extra time tomorrow as I do not want to fall behind on the Udemy course days in comparison to how many days I have been doing #100DaysOfCode.
